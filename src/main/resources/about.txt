This bot is written in Java using Spring Boot, JDA, and GraphQL.
It authenticates to fflogs.com using OAuth2 client credentials to access the public /v2/client API
Usage:
```
$log <char name>@<server>
where
  <char name> is a character's full name
and
  <server> is the server where the character is located
```
The bot will crawl through the user's encounters and then dive into the report for each cleared fight to identify how many times that character **did a mechanic wrong** :upside_down:.

Pardon the dust. It's still slow because I have to sort out the graphql and inefficient lookups.
